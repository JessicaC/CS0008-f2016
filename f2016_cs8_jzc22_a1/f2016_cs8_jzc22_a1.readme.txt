Prompts the user which system he/she wants to use
sys = input("Which system do you want to use, USC or Metric?")
Ask user for distance driven and how much gasoline was used; the units depend on the system selected by user
distance = float(input("Distance driven: "))
gasoline = float(input("Gasoline used: "))
Print the amounts
if sys == 'USC':
    print(distance + "miles")
elif sys == 'Metric':
    print(distance + "km")
Convert the quantities
if sys == 'USC':
    newdis = distance * 1.60934
    newgas = gasoline * 3.78541
    print(newdis + 'km')
    print(newgas + 'liters')
elif sys == 'Metric':
    newdis = distance / 0.621371
    newgas = gasoline / 0.264172
    print(newdis + 'miles')
    print(newgas + 'gallons')
