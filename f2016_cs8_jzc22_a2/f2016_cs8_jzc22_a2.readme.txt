Define the two functions, processfile(fh) and printkv(key, value, klen=0).
Under processfile(fh), get the number of lines in the file and sum up the total values in the file
Make sure to strip the comma that is between the name and distance.
Return the two values - linecount and sumtotal.
Under printkv(key, value, klen=0), get the length of "key".
If kn is greater than klen, which is zero, 'space' is assigned the variable kn.
The format of the value changes according to the type of value contained in the variable.
If it is an int,
Otherwise,
Initialize the values of the overall lines count and values.
Ask user for the file to be read.
If user inputs 'quit', 'q', or an empty string, end the loop
